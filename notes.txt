modules (parts of node)

console.log(module)
run node filename
shows meta data about the js file

module is object, can be mutated and can share stuff between files

each file has its own module

used by putting
module.exports = variable
into js file

variable is available to other js files

in 2nd js file require('./file1.js') is used to link the file, the dot is used to show its in the same file

both file 1 and 2 are in same folder

file 2 is run in terminal, and info from file 1 can be used

module is variable that represents a link to a file

an array can be used to collect the data together to enable more variables to be used
now the array is shared between the files

object is better to use so the labels can be applied to the values

then the log in file 2 can use the standard object format key.object

if variable and key have same name the key.object format doesnt have to be used

key.key becomes just key

functions can also be made available to other files
individually or all at once

functions are bundled into an object
the key in the 2nd file is invoked

modules.exports should be at the bottom of the file
use require at the top of the js file

to check you are exporting use console.log(module ) and check what it says in exports, default is empty object

when you require from another file the entire file is executed
require will run the whole file being required

tasks are in calender
